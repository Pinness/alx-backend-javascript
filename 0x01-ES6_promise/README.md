# Promises, Async/Await, and Error Handling in JavaScript

This project explores JavaScript Promises, `async/await`, and error handling techniques. It covers creating, using, and managing promises, as well as writing clean and efficient asynchronous code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly:
- What are Promises? How, why, and what?
- How to use `.then()`, `.resolve()`, and `.catch()` methods.
- How to use every method of the `Promise` object.
- How to handle errors using `throw` and `try/catch`.
- The `await` operator and how it simplifies asynchronous code.
- Writing and using `async` functions effectively.
